        <h1>EzyFit Getting Started</h1>
        <hr>

        <br>

        <p>The EzyFit toolbox for Matlab enables you to perform simple curve fitting
        of one-dimensional data using arbitrary fitting functions. It provides
        command-line functions and a basic graphical user interface for interactive
        selection of the data.</p>

        <br>

        <h2>Why using EzyFit?</h2>
    
        <p>There are three ways to perform curve fitting with Matlab: the first
        one is using the 'Basic Fitting Interface' of Matlab, the second one is using
        <tt>fminsearch</tt> with anonymous functions, and the third one
        is to pay for the
        <a href="matlab:web http://www.mathworks.com/products/curvefitting/ -browser">Curve Fitting Toolbox</a>.
        However, for usual curve fitting of 1D data, you may find the first solution
        rather limited, the second one a little complicated, and the third one quite
        expensive...</p>

        <p>The EzyFit Toolbox provides a free, simple and efficient way to
        perform quick curve fitting with arbitrary (nonlinear) fitting functions:
        You just have to type something like <tt>showfit('c+a/x^n')</tt> and EzyFit gives
        you the values for <tt>c</tt>, <tt>a</tt> and <tt>n</tt> and shows you the
        curve! EzyFit also provides a basic graphical user interface
        to interactively fit selected parts of your data.</p>

        <br>

        <h2>First step: fitting data from the EzyFit menu</h2>

        <p>First plot some sample data by typing 
        <tt><a href="plotsample.html">plotsample</a></tt>
        in the command window (or simply click <a href="matlab:plotsample">here</a>
        to display the sample figure).</p>

        <p>In the <tt>EzyFit</tt> menu of the figure window, select <tt>Showfit</tt>
        and
        choose an appropriate fitting function to fit the sample data. You may also click
        on the link that appears in the command window to choose the default
        fitting function associated to the sample plot. If the menu is not present in
        your figure window, type <tt><a href="efmenu.html">efmenu</a></tt>,
        or see the step 4 in the <a href="ezyfit_install.html">installation procedure</a>.</p>

        <p><img src="ezyfit_efmenu.jpg"></p>
        
        <p>Choose <tt>Undo Fit</tt> if you want to remove the fit.</p>

        <p>If multiple curves are present in the figure,
        first select the one you want to fit, and then choose <tt>Showfit</tt>.</p>

        <p>Two additional functions, <tt><a href="getslope.html">getslope</a></tt> and
        <tt><a href="showslope.html">showslope</a></tt>, return the slope of the selected
        line (use the menu
        <tt>Insert &gt; Line</tt>), or drag a line of fixed slope, for a fit "by eye"
        of your data.</p>

        <br>

        <h2>Second step: fitting data from the command window</h2>
    
        <p>Although fitting your data from the <tt>EzyFit</tt> menu is fast and easy,
        using the command-line functions is much more powerful, and allows for
        using different properties for each fit (See the <a href="ezyfit_settings.html">Settings
        page</a> for details).</p>

        <p>The key function of the toolbox is <tt><a href="ezfit.html">ezfit</a></tt>,
        which computes the coefficients that fit the data. The function
        <tt><a href="showfit.html">showfit</a></tt> simply calls the function
        <tt><a href="ezfit.html">ezfit</a></tt> for the active curve, using the
        "Data Brushing" tool of Matlab (available since version 7.6).
        Type <a href="undofit.html">undofit</a> to remove the last fit.</p>

        <p>This example fits some noisy data by a power law <tt>c * x^n</tt> and plots the result:</p>

        <blockquote><pre><tt>
plotsample power           % a power law
showfit c*x^n
        </tt></pre></blockquote>


        <p>This example fits an histogram with a Gaussian, and displays the coefficients in
        the Array Editor:</p>

        <blockquote><pre><tt>
plotsample hist           % an histogram
f = ezfit('gauss');       % fits with a Gaussian
f                         % displays the fit structure
showfit(f);               % displays the fit
editcoeff(f);             % opens the Array Editor
        </tt></pre></blockquote>
